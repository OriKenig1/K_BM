# K_BM

MATLAB implementation of the K-BM algorithm

The code includes the K-BM for GMM and model order selection via the K-BIC.

## How to Run

The COMPLETE_KBM.m is the main routine for running the K-BM algorithm.

To run it, follow these steps:

    (1) Add all folders and sub folders in this reposetory to your MATLAB path

    (2) Run RUN_COMPLETE_KBM.m

For faster results, we recommend enabling the parallel option in Matlab.

The code was written and tested in MATLAB R2022b.
