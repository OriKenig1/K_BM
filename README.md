# K_BM

MATLAB implementation of the K-BM algorithm

The K_BM.m is the main routine for running the K_BM algorithm.

To run the example in Test_K_BM.m:

(1) Add ( not including sub-folders ) the K_BM folder to the Matlab path

(2) Add the K_BM/utils folder to the Matlab path

(3) Run Test_K_BM.m

For faster results, we recommend enabling the parallel option in Matlab.

The code was written and tested in MATLAB R2022b.
